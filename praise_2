On calls, amidst the auditor's stern array,
He champions our cause, without delay.
Wholeheartedly defending with words so clear,
Preserving our production's atmosphere dear.

In P's guidance, empathy takes flight,
In his support, we find our might.
A rare line manager, in him, we confide,
With his strong prudence, all our fears subside.
